We know the economic impacts of COVID-19 have been severe. Advanced and developing countries alike have experienced massive job losses, economic contraction, falling investments and exports, and declining tourism dollars. The impact of COVID-19 on poverty, however, is less clear. We typically get poverty estimates from household survey data, which have been difficult to carry out during the last year. Thus, it may be a year or two before the full impact of the pandemic is known. However, we do know that economic growth is the largest driver of poverty reduction. Conversely, economic recessions drive a rise in poverty, other things being equal. Yet other things were not equal in 2020. Countries responded to the pandemic with large social spending programs to mitigate the worst of the economic shock and keep families afloat. Advanced economies provided trillions of direct and indirect fiscal support, equivalent to 2to 28 percent of their GDP. Emerging and developing economies spent 7 percent and 2 percent of GDP respectively. The World Bank estimates that in March 2020, there were 103 active social protection programs in 45 countries. This number jumped to 1,414 programs in 215 countries by December 2020. These measures likely kept many families from falling back into poverty.<br>We can be more confident about the long-term impacts of COVID-19. The pandemic, all else being equal, might lead to a temporary rise in poverty in some places before returning to its pre-COVID trajectory as growth rates rebound in 2021 and 2022. In other places, however, growth was low pre-COVID-19 and is predicted to be low for the next decade. In these countries, governments also had less fiscal space for mitigating policy response measures. Using long-term GDP growth projections from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), we estimate where poverty will likely be concentrated in 2030, and what we can do to reverse these trends.

<li><h2><u>UNEMPLOYMENT</u></li></h2>
<br>
If you are receiving unemployment benefits [state or federal regular unemployment compensation, including Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE), Unemployment Compensation for Ex-Servicemembers (UCX), PEUC, PUA, Extended Benefits (EB), Short-Time Compensation (STC), Trade Readjustment Allowances (TRA), Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA), or the Self-Employment Assistance Program (SEA)], you will receive an additional $300 per week as a supplemental amount to unemployment benefits for weeks of unemployment ending by March 14, 2021.<br>
PUA still applies to self-employed workers, gig workers, independent contractors, and other people who donâ€™t usually qualify for unemployment insurance. The PUA program is extended to March 14, 2021. If you receive PUA during the week ending March 14, 2021, have not exhausted all rights to PUA, and are otherwise eligible for PUA benefits, there is a transition period through weeks of unemployment that begin no later than April 5, 2021, for which PUA benefits are payable. No PUA is payable for any week of unemployment beginning after April 5, 2021. In addition, the maximum PUA eligibility has been extended from 39 weeks to 50 weeks (minus the weeks the individual received regular unemployment benefits and Extended Benefits).<br>
Similarly, the PEUC program is extended to March 14, 2021. If you receive PEUC during the week ending March 14, 2021, have not exhausted all rights to PEUC, and are otherwise eligible for PEUC, there is a transition period through weeks of unemployment that begin no later than April 5, 2021, for which PEUC benefits are payable. No PEUC is payable for any week of unemployment beginning after April 5, 2021. In addition, the length of time an eligible individual can receive PEUC has been extended from 13 weeks to 24 weeks.
